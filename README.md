# Price-Prediction---Advanced-Regression-Technique
The data set was taken from kaggle competition based on House Price Prediction ,  there was a lot Feature Engineering in this data set after that I used Randomized Search Cv to tune my hyperparameters and used XGBoost regressor for prediction and with the help of these techniques my RME score on the public leaderboard will be 0.1398 and my rank was 2500 and now I use to apply ANN(Artificial Neural Network) to improve my score.
